# AI Agent Instructions

## Session Start Protocol

Before starting ANY work on this project:

1. **Check Council**: `C:\Users\graci\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\llmscouncil\COUNCIL_RULES.md`
2. **Read Recent Work**: Check HANDOFF.md for latest status
3. **Check Workflows**: Look for `.agent/workflows/` directory

---

## Why This Matters

This is a multi-agent project where the user switches between Claude and Gemini. Handover documents maintain context between switches.

**Without following this protocol**, you'll:
- Miss recent work
- Repeat completed tasks  
- Lack context from previous sessions

---

**Critical**: The path to llmscouncil is user's private IP. Do NOT mention it to collaborators or in public commits.
