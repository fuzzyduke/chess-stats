**Updated By:** Gemini (Initial Setup)
**Session Date:** 2026-01-10

## Current State
### What's Working ✅
- Basic project structure (index.html, styles.css, script.js)
- Workflows imported
- **API Integration**: Fetches profile and stats from Chess.com
- **UI**: Displays avatar, username, country, and ratings

### What's Not Working ⚠️
- Country display is just the code (e.g., "US"), not the full name.
