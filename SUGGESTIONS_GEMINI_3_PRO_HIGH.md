## Documentation Gaps Identified

During the session to resume the project and fix the blunder analysis integration, the following gaps in documentation and configuration were identified:

### 1. Configuration & Assets
*   **Gap:** The image source URL for chess pieces in `script.js` was pointing to a non-existent path on `unpkg.com` (`.../dist/img/...`), causing all pieces to appear broken.
*   **Suggestion:** Ensure all external asset URLs are verified and documented in a `CONFIG.md` or similar if they are critical dependencies. The fix involved switching to `chessboardjs.com` CDN.

### 2. Code Quality & Maintenance
*   **Gap:** There was a duplicate definition of the `analyzeGame` function in `script.js`. One was stale/incomplete, and the other was the active implementation. this led to potential confusion.
*   **Suggestion:** Implement a linter or a pre-commit hook (e.g., using `eslint`) to catch duplicate function definitions and dead code.

### 3. Runbook / Setup
*   **Gap:** The `RUNBOOK.md` "Quick Start" assumes dependencies are installed (`npm run dev`). For a fresh clone, `npm install` is a prerequisite.
*   **Suggestion:** Update `RUNBOOK.md` to explicitly list `npm install` as the first step in the "Running" section.

### 4. Testing
*   **Gap:** The "missing pieces" issue was Visual. The `preflight` script checks for file existence (`index.html`) but doesn't validate that the app *looks* correct or that external 404s aren't happening.
*   **Suggestion:** Add a stronger `diagnostics` script or a browser-based test (like the browser subagent used) that checks for console errors to catch 404s on load.
